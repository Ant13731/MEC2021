McMaster Engineering Competition Programming Category Submission

A voting system prototype that identifies users with a valid Photo ID and counts votes.

## Summary of File Folder and Contents
- LambdaPandas_MEC21.py
   - Main submission
- LambdaPandas_MEC21_Lesser_Dependencies.py
   - Watered-down version of the main submission, but does not require as many dependencies. Some dependencies did not work on Windows machines, so this may help. However, the photo identification authentication system is not implemented here, and table formatting is not as nice.
